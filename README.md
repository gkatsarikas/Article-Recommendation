# Article-Recommendation
This repository contains Python code implementing algorithms to solve multi-armed bandit problems, a common problem in Reinforcement Learning. In this repository, we are going to use the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Epsilon-Greedy Algorithms to recommend a fixed number of articles to some users, based on their click probabilities for each article.
